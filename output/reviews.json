The platform's scalability is impressive, easily accommodating our organization's growth from 200 to 1,500 users without performance degradation, while the comprehensive audit trail functionality ensures we maintain regulatory compliance across all departments. While the advanced permission settings could benefit from a more intuitive interface, and the initial implementation requires significant IT resources, these minor drawbacks are outweighed by the platform's strengths in security, compliance, and enterprise-grade capabilities.",
