While the pricing is competitive, particularly with the freemium model offering a decent set of features, the limitations on user collaboration in the lower-tier plans are a notable drawback. Overall, it's a solid choice for small to medium-sized projects, but may not be the best fit for larger, more complex endeavors.",
